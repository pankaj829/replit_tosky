# BTAssetHub AI Assistant Demo Script

"Welcome to our demo of the BTAssetHub AI Assistant! Let me walk you through this powerful tool.

[Pointing to screen] Here's our AI assistant with its clean, user-friendly interface. Users simply type their questions here and get instant answers.

Let me show you how it works in real-time. Watch what happens when I ask about our services...

[Types question] "What services does BTAssetHub offer?"

See how quickly it responds with a complete overview? In just seconds, users get the exact information they need without searching through multiple pages.

Now let's try something about getting started...

[Types question] "How do I get started with investing?"

Notice how it breaks down the process into clear steps. This is crucial for converting visitors into clients - they get immediate clarity at decision points.

Now let's try something more complex...

[Types question] "What types of real estate can be tokenized and what are the minimum investment amounts?"

See how it handles this multi-part question? The AI draws from your knowledge base to provide detailed information that would take minutes to find manually. This saves users valuable time while demonstrating your platform's capabilities.

Let me demonstrate another key feature. Watch what happens when I ask something unrelated...

[Types question] "What's the capital of France?"

The assistant politely redirects the conversation back to BTAssetHub topics. This protects your brand from inaccurate information while keeping users focused.

Let me also show you how we handle connection issues. Sometimes networks can be unreliable...

[Shows error message] "Connection timeout. The server took too long to respond."

See this red retry button? Users can simply click it and...

[Clicks retry button]
